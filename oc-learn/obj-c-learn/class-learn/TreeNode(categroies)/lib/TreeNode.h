/*NOTE:
1. category cannot add instance variables
2. can override but not recommand
3. Any methods that you declare in a category will be available to all instances of the original class, as well as any subclasses of the original class. At runtime, thereâ€™s no difference between a method added by a category and one that is implemented by the original class.*/
